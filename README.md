# AmandaKyleJeffMatt

For this project we made an app with the intention of reducing waste and feeding those in need. On the home page there are 2 buttons, one to donate food and the other to find food. The donor will fill out a form with all of their information, address, contact, type of food, amount of food and when it is available to be picked up. Their information will be pushed to a table where the recipients can easily see what kind of food and where it will be for them to come and pick up. 

The find button will take user to a different form so they can fill out their contact information, type of organization and address. They will then be taken to the table so they can choose the items they would like to pick up. 

We used google places and google maps API to auto fill out the forms with addresses and then to load a map with directions from place to place. We used firebase to store the data from the donate form to the table. 

Other technologies used:

HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript
