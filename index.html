        <h1>Food Finders</h1>

        <!-- I thought here we could do some research about food waste, and local shelters/non-profits in need of donated food and describe what we are doing,
        how to use it, and also some stats on why this is important. For now I've just copied what Jeff sent to the TAS about the project -->


        <p id="about-paragraph">Food finders... Uber for food donations. We are planning on making a proof of concept
            web app that helps
            connect Non-profit food finder programs/ freelnace volunteers with hotels, restaurants, and grocery stores
            that have excess food. An institution that has excess food can logon to their profile and list what food
            they have and the quantity, this will then ping the volunteer and the volunteer can decide what jobs they
            intend on filling. The web app will also point the volunteer to the closest non-profit food bank. We will
            implement the google maps api to get the location data on the volunteers and location of food waste and a
            firebase database to help notify the volunteers. We will get the directions and time until arrival from
            google maps and we intend on using the yelp api to help auto create profiles for institutions.</p>
